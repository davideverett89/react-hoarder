# Description
This project is a simple exploration into React routing.  As a user, you are a hoarder who uses this app as a log of all of the junk that you have accumulated.  It uses `react-router-dom` to move between various page components that includes a landing page, a page that allows the user to see all of the things they are hoarding, a page in which the user can add more stuff to their collection, a single view page so he or she can inspect an item more closely, and an edit page to make changes to his or her items.
